## **Introduction**

This document shows program architecture and implementation decisions for the contact-and-event management app, Athena.

##### **Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to provide technical details and explanations for the high-level design of Athena and each subcomponent that Athena uses. 
The intended audience for this document is software engineers maintaining or expanding on Athena, and software testers.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -c 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassOverviewDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model` encapsulates all data required for Athena to run. In particular, it stores all contacts (as `person` objects), `tag`s and `event`s.
It is meant to fulfill the Facade pattern as the Facade class by hiding the individual classes that store the individual entities and forcing higher level components like the `Command`s and `Logic` to interact only with `Model`.
It is made up of three major components:

1. `AddressBook` which manages the contacts in the form of `Person` objects.
1. `Calendar` which manages the events in the form of `Event` objects.
1. `TagTree` which manages `tag` to `tag` relations.

Additionally, `Model` also has the following characteristics: 
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Displaying introduction window

##### General design
An introduction window is displayed by Athena for users unfamiliar with how the application works. This is done by
checking if either `AddressBook.json` or `Calendar.json` exist in the designated save-path. If neither are found, Athena
assumes that the user has not opened the application before, and will display the introduction window. The introduction
comprises a tutorial on basic command use that prompts users to make changes to the default save, and thus will create
a new save file.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between `UiManager`, `MainWindow`, `LogicManager` and
`IntroCommand` when the application is launched.

![intro_sequence_diagram](images/IntroSequenceDiagram.png)

This implementation deviates from the sequence regular commands obey (see below) by implementing `executeIntro()`,
whereas regular commands use `execute(String)`. This is to prevent users from being able to display the introduction
window through the invocation of a command.

##### Design choice

As the introduction window should be displayed when the application is opened, any method calls has to be done while
the system is aware that the application is in the phase of being set up. As a result, determining whether the
introduction window should be shown is done when the Ui is being created and filled in.

An important factor to consider when implementing this command is to prevent users from being to invoke it. This means
that, unlike regular commands, no keyword parsed should call the method, and thus it can be entirely absent from
`AddressBookParser`. Since it should not be parseable, regular methods that are used to handle command inputs are
inapplicable, thus necessitating creation of custom methods such as `handleIntro()` and `executeIntroCommand()`.

##### Design improvements

As the presence of save files are used to check if the introduction window should be shown, Athena will falsely flag
users who have no save file as first time users and show the introduction window nonetheless.

### Contact and tag management
![contact_tag_diagram](images/ContactTagDiagram.png)

##### General design
**`Person`** component: 

In Athena, contacts are represented by `Person` objects. `Person` objects have several properties such as email, address, etc. A `Person` can also be tagged with multiple `Tag`s.
- `AddressBook` handles all direct matters concerning `Person` objects. It has a `TagManager` and `UniquePersonList`.  
- `UniquePersonList` keeps track of all `Person` objects. It uses `Person` class' `isSamePerson(Person)` method to ensure that there are no duplicate contacts in Athena.
- `TagManager` keeps track of which contacts contain which tags. It uses a hash map, mapping each `Tag` to the set of `Person`s that contain the `Tag`. 

All manipulation of `Person` objects have to be done through `AddressBook`. `AddressBook` provides simple methods that can be used by higher-level components such as 
- `void removePerson(Person)`
- `void addPerson(Person)`
- `boolean hasPerson(Person)`
- and more

**`Tag`** component:

`Tag`s are represented by a single alphanumeric string with no spaces. There is support for child-tagging. This allows directional relations to be established between `Tag`s. Certain commands will group a `Tag` together with its child-tags to perform an action.
- `TagTree` handles tag-to-tag relations. 
- `TagTreeImpl` extends from the abstract class `TagTree`. It uses a tree data structure to store directional tag-to-tag relations. 
The implementation of the tree is done with a hash map, mapping each `Tag` to its set of child-tags. 

Any new links established between tags have to go through the `TagTree`. `TagTree` provides several simple methods such as 
- `void addSubTagTo(Tag tag)`  
- `boolean hasTag(Tag tag)`  
- and more

**`Integration`** component:

The `ContactTagIntegrationManager` class provides a few predefined methods that affect both `Person`s and `Tag`s together. Methods include:
- `void deleteTag(Tag)`
- `void deleteTagRecursive(Tag)` - deletes a `Tag` and all its sub-tags
- and more

This class is meant to address the difficulty in preserving consistency within the system.
For example, two different `deleteTag` methods are implemented in both `TagTree` and `ContactTagIntegrationManager`.
However, the method in `TagTree` only deletes the specific `Tag` in `TagTree`.
The method in `ContactTagIntegrationManager` uses `TagTree`'s `deleteTag(Tag)` method, then removes the `Tag` from all `Person` objects that has the `Tag`.
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the `ContactTagIntegrationManager`, `AddressBook` and `TagTree` when `execute("delete -t t/cs2103")`.

![delete-tag-demonstration](images/DeleteTagSequenceDiagram.png)

As such, the `ContactTagIntegrationManager`'s job is to preserve consistency in the `Model` when a change is made to `Tag`s that will affect `Person`s stored.
Thus, higher-level modules should use the methods in `ContactTagIntegrationManager` if available.

##### Design choice
In the context of tag management, this design choice is aimed at properly encapsulating two separate functionalities.
1. `AddressBook` - uses `TagManager` to track which `Person` objects falls under which `Tag`s. 
    - `TagManager` is necessary to avoid cyclic dependency between `Person` and `Tag`. 
    - `TagManager` is embedded in `AddressBook`, so whenever there is a change to the list of `Person`s, the tag-to-person map can be updated immediately.
2. `TagTree` tracks the tag-to-tag relationships only. In particular, it keeps track of which set of `Tag`s are child-tags of which `Tag`. 

Using these two mutable constructs, it allows for accurate realtime queries by higher-level components even though the internal mapping changes frequently between commands.
To ensure that the right commands are called at the right time, `Model` only implements a limited set of methods that can change the internal mapping.
To support a greater variety of `Command`s, ensure that the correct methods from either `AddressBook`, `TagTree` or `ContactTagIntegrationManager` are chosen. 
A rule of thumb is to search for the method in `ContactTagIntegrationManager` first before looking for a similar method in the other two classes. 
 
To view the full list of methods and documentation for the three major classes, you can view them at [`AddressBook`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java), 
[`TagTree`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/tag/TagTree.java) and [`ContactTagIntegrationManager`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ContactTagIntegrationManager.java).

##### Design improvement
A possible way to improve the current design is to remove dependency from `ModelManager` to `TagTree`, `AddressBook` and `ContactTagIntegrationManager` by creating another Facade class containing these three classes.
As such, only the relevant methods required for specific `Command`s to work will be exposed to `Model`. For example, right now, both `ContactTagIntegrationManager`'s `deleteTag(Tag)` method and `TagTree`'s `deleteTag(Tag)` method are exposed to `ModelManager` when only one of them is actually used.
This makes it easier for others working at a similar level of abstraction to avoid using the wrong methods.  

##### Additional notes:
_Definitions_:
- For a `Tag` to _exist_ in Athena, the `Tag` must have either at least one `Person` with the `Tag` **or** at least one child-tag.
- A _child-tag_ of a tag signifies a directional relation from a tag to its _child-tag_. It allows for some commands that affect a tag to also affect its _child-tag_. The reverse cannot be done. The other tag in the relationship is the _parent-tag_.
- _Parent-tag_: see _child-tag_.
- A _sub-tag_ of a tag signifies a multi-step directional relation from a tag to the _sub-tag_ (i.e. a sub-tag of a tag is a child-tag, or a child-tag of a child-tag, etc.).
A child-tag of a tag is also a _sub-tag_.
 
_Delete single tag behavior_: <br>
Suppose we delete a single `Tag`, the parent-tags of `Tag` will be reconnected to the child-tags of `Tag` as illustrated by the image below.
<br>
![single-tag-delete](images/DeleteSingleTagPic.png) <br>
We have intentionally chosen this design in order to preserve the effectiveness of top-down queries of all sub-tags.

### Sort events feature
The sort events feature is facilitated by `Calendar` that stores event entries and their details in Athena. 

Additionally, it executes the sorting operation based on 2 sorting patterns:
* `sort -e 1` - Sorts the events based on the description of the events in alphabetical order.
* `sort -e 2` - Sorts the events based on the time of the events in chronological order. 

SortEventCommand#execute() : Does validity check of input and then sorts the event according to user input (index))

The sorting function is designed with the aim of temporary modification of the event-related entries in the `Calendar`. 
This is to create a default sorting pattern (based on the description of the events in alphabetical order) for easier reference. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort -e` operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort -e 1` Command](images/SortEventSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Temporarily sorts the event entries.
  * Pros: Will use less memory.
  * Cons: May cause inconvenience to the users.

* **Alternative 2:** Automatically sorts the event entries based on one sorting order as they are being added/ deleted/ edited.
  * Pros: Will be more convenient for the users. (As they do not need to manually sort) 
  * Cons: May restrict the usage and benefit of the app. (As only one sorting pattern is available)
  
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `sort -e` command:
  
![CommitActivityDiagram](images/SortEventActivityDiagram.png)

### List events feature

### Display feature
The display feature for the events is facilitated by `Calendar` that stores event entries and their details in Athena,
and has a specific command of `list -e` where the command makes use of `ListEventCommand`. 

ListEventCommand#execute() : Does validity check of current list and displayed all event-related entries.

##### Aspect: How list executes
The feature is designed to provide the users with the entire list of event-related entries, especially after 
when user executes certain commands that display partial list of event list (e.g. SearchEvent Command).

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts and events
* requires seamless integration between contact and event tracking (vastly differing participants for different events, for instance)
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage contacts and events faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

   1. Test case: `delete -c 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete -c`, `delete -c x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### Adding a tag

1. Adding a new tag to various contacts

## **Appendix: Effort**

* **Contact and Tag management**: It was difficult to come up with a good OOP solution in order to keep track of tag-contact and tag-tag relations while avoiding cyclic dependency. Such functionality was not present within AB3 prior so it had to be implemented from scratch.
Additionally, a major challenge was that we intended to implement commands that could affect tags and persons in a way where other persons and tags that were not specified could also be affected (e.g. deleting a tag requires removal of the tag from contacts with it).
There were also issues that were more difficult to spot, such as the ability to create cyclic relations between tags.
As such, multiple solutions and designs were considered, outlining exact behavior that could be supported and allowed within this tracking system.
Extensive testing was also necessary for every single method as many higher-level components and commands rely on accurate queries of tags and persons.
